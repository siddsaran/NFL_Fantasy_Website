# NFL Fantasy Website
This is a full-stack project that uses React.js for frontend and Spring Boot/PostgreSQL for backend.

1. Find the URL of the 2024 NFL statistics and perform webscraping to create the csv data 
2. Use PostgreSQL to create a table in the database to put the csv contents in
3. Use Spring Boot backend to handle filtering the Player entities based on various factors, such as position, team, and name.
4. Use JavaScript and CSS frontend to have a dynamic display of the content and a smooth user interface
